# Editors

The Editors manage the cookbook quality metrics repository and assist with the
workflow. They are not responsible for managing the content of RFCs, only
formatting and procedure. To volunteer as an editor please create a pull request
against this document that adds your name to the list. The existing editors will
vote on the request, with the Lieutenant retaining veto power.

When a metric has been approved, an editor will:

* Assign a number to the quality metric by updating the name of the file and
  the `SMQM` field
* Move the file from `quality-metrics/new` to `quality-metrics/`
* Update the status to `Accepted`

The current editors are:
